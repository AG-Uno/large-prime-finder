# Big list of primes!
# The prime numbers are listed one to each line in a format designed to
# be easily consumed by a big integer implementation. Format as follows:
# Number of bytes in the number as a hex encoded little endian 32 bit int.
# Following the 8 characters indicating the number of bytes, the bytes of
# the number follow. Each byte is 2 hex characters, and the bytes are listed
# least significant first. 
0100_02 # int value: 2
0100_03 # int value: 3
0100_05 # int value: 5
0100_07 # int value: 7
0100_0B # int value: 11
0100_0D # int value: 13
