# Big list of primes!
# The prime numbers are listed one to each line in a format designed to
# be easily consumed by a big integer implementation. Format as follows:
# Number of bytes in the number as a hex encoded little endian 32 bit int.
# Following the 8 characters indicating the number of bytes, the bytes of
# the number follow. Each byte is 2 hex characters, and the bytes are listed
# least significant first. 
0100000002 # int value: 2
0100000003 # int value: 3
0100000005 # int value: 5
0100000007 # int value: 7
010000000B # int value: 11
010000000D # int value: 13
